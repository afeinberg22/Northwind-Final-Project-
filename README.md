# Overview 

In this project, I use the Welch's T Test to understand the statitical significance of the following 4 exploratory questions:

1)Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?
2)Does whether or not a product was regionally imported or domestically handled impact the discount of the order?
3)Does the volume of territories owned by an employer have a statistically significant effect on an employers order performance? 
4)Does number of customers in a country have a statistically significant effect on the amount of total orders?

The questions I ask are centered around insights that are important for a business to make decisions on. For all 4 questions we were able to confidently prove our hypthosesis with over a 99% certainty.
